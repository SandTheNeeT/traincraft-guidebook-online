## Basic Info
* As this is not my primary focus, you can not expect frequent updates/changes.
* The main reason I created this was because I was frustrated from current ingame wiki/guidebook which would be usable.
* This guidebook comes with a few QoL enhancemets and improvements. Currently not hosted anywhere publicly.
